# world-cup-chart

A world cup from Udacity's d3 course. 

Open index.html to check out the code and some notes. 

On this chart, we cycle through all the years the world cup took place showing participating and host countries. After animation is over, a series of buttons appear on the screen where a user can click and see each year's results. Two years are missing, and those correspond to the years during the second world war.

The narrative created around this chart would expose how as transportation improved the participating countries would be located geographically farther from the host country.
While correlation may not be causation, one can see how as travelling became easier attendance increased.
